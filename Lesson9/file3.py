# Abstraction hides internal details and shows only the functionality.

# Python provides ABC (Abstract Base Class) using the abc module.

# If you inherit a abstract class then the child class has to implement all the abstract methods of the parent class else the child class
# will also be considered as Abstract class

# ‚ùó You can't instantiate Shape directly because it has an abstract method.
